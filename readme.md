Why this project matters
- A single tool to handle three common PC maintenance tasks.
- Reduces clutter and errors from scattered utilities.
- Provides clear feedback on actions and outcomes.
- Aims to be safe by offering backups and restore points before changes.

Core features
- System Cleaner: remove junk files, unused traces, and temporary data.
- Registry Cleaner: detect and fix non‑essential or obsolete registry entries.
- Startup Manager: control which programs run on boot, speeding up startup time.
- Safe operations: optional backups of changes, with easy restore if something goes wrong.
- Lightweight and fast: designed to run with minimal impact on everyday use.
- Extensible architecture: modules designed to evolve with new cleaning targets and cleanup strategies.

How it fits into your workflow
- Regular maintenance: run a quick cleanup weekly or monthly.
- Pre‑update preparation: clean up before major software updates.
- Performance tuning: prune startup entries to shave seconds from boot time.
- Troubleshooting: identify clutter and misconfigurations that affect performance.

Getting started
Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or newer with administrator rights.
- Adequate disk space for temporary files and backups.
- A working internet connection for initial download and updates.

Download and install
- The releases page hosts the installer for Windows.
- From the Releases page, download the Windows installer file named ccleaner-tools_setup-win64.exe and run it.
- Follow the on‑screen prompts to install. Choose a suitable destination folder and enable optional features if you need them.
- After installation, launch the application from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

What to expect on first run
- The software performs an initial scan to establish a baseline.
- You see a summary of items found by each module.
- You can review items before applying any changes.
- Recommended to back up important data and create a system restore point before making changes.

How to use the tool
- Start with a quick scan in each module to see what can be cleaned or optimized.
- Review results in a clear list with categories, affected files, and potential impact.
- Apply changes or schedule them for later.
- Use the backup option for registry or system changes when available.

Module 1: System Cleaner
- Purpose: remove unnecessary files that take up space and may slow the system.
- What it cleans: temporary files, cache, older logs, orphaned data, and stray leftovers from uninstalled apps.
- Why it helps: frees disk space, reduces file system fragmentation, and can improve application responsiveness.
- How it works: the cleaner runs a set of safe, non-destructive scans first, then offers recommended removals with a preview.
- Safety features: if a risky item is found, the user can review and opt to back up before removal.
- Best practices:
  - Run a quick clean weekly on busy systems.
  - Perform a deeper clean monthly, depending on usage.
  - Always review large or unexpected removals.

Module 2: Registry Cleaner
- Purpose: identify obsolete or invalid registry entries that may slow down or destabilize the system.
- What it targets: orphaned references, invalid paths, and entries left behind after software uninstall.
- Why it helps: can improve startup time and overall system responsiveness.
- How it works: the cleaner presents a risk assessment for each item before you apply changes.
- Safety features: option to back up the registry and create a system restore point before changes.
- Best practices:
  - Run registry cleaning cautiously and only after creating a backup.
  - Do not remove entries you do not recognize. When in doubt, leave it be.

Module 3: Startup Manager
- Purpose: control which programs launch at system startup.
- Why it matters: fewer startup programs means faster boot times and less background activity.
- How it works: lists startup entries with clear labels, publishers, and impact estimates.
- How to use:
  - Disable rarely used items to improve boot speed.
  - Keep essential tools enabled for system health and security.
  - Create startup groups for different use cases (work, gaming, travel).
- Safety features: the tool warns before disabling essential system processes and shows dependency notes.

Architecture and design
- Clean, modular layout: each module is isolated for easy maintenance.
- Clear user interface: lists and previews keep users informed before changes.
- Safe defaults: the default settings favor user safety and data protection.
- Extensibility: the codebase is organized to add new cleaners, new checks, and new startup management options without rewriting core logic.
- Logging: operations produce easy-to-read logs with timestamps and impact notes.
- Observability: lightweight telemetry options help understand what users do (without exposing sensitive data).

Getting into details
- Data flow: scan results are collected, grouped by module, and presented in a dashboard with actionable items.
- Decision points: the user decides which items to remove or modify and can opt to back up before changes.
- Rollback: backed-up data allows you to revert if needed.

Safety, backups, and best practices
- Backups before changes: registry edits and system changes offer a backup option.
- Restore points: you can create a system restore point prior to applying changes.
- Preview before apply: every change is shown as a preview so you can review impact.
- Reversible actions: when possible, actions are reversible with a restore path.
- User responsibility: the tool helps, but the user decides which actions to take.

CLI and automation
- Command-line interface (CLI): supports targeted operations for power users and automation.
- Example commands (inline):
  - ccleaner-tools.exe --scan-system
  - ccleaner-tools.exe --clean-system
  - ccleaner-tools.exe --scan-registry
  - ccleaner-tools.exe --repair-registry --backup
  - ccleaner-tools.exe --manage-startup --disable-all-nonessential
  - ccleaner-tools.exe --schedule-clean --time 02:00
- Scripting and automation: integrate with task schedulers to run regular maintenance.
- Return codes: the CLI reports success, partial success, or errors with clear messages.

User interface and experience
- Clean visuals: consistent fonts, colors, and spacing to reduce eye strain.
- Quick actions: prominent buttons for common tasks.
- Help and hints: contextual tips appear during the first use and after major updates.
- Localization: plans to add multiple languages for global use.

Safety and data handling
- Privacy: the tool does not collect sensitive data by default.
- Transparency: all operations are visible, with detailed logs.
- Data integrity: cleaners only remove data that is safe to delete or repairable.

Performance considerations
- Resource use: designed to run with minimal CPU and memory.
- Impact controls: you can set the depth of scans to reduce background activity.
- Scheduling: plan scans at off-peak hours to avoid slowing active work.

Troubleshooting and support
- Common issues: missing permissions, blocked registry access, or inconsistent startup lists.
- Quick fixes:
  - Run as administrator for full access.
  - Reboot after a major cleanup to ensure changes take effect.
  - Use the backup option to restore if something goes wrong.
- Getting help: use the built-in help in the app or visit the releases page for the latest guides and notes.
